A journal that sorts your journal entries based off your mood and allows you to visualize how often you journal in different moods. It is a great tool to collect data to understand yourself and how and when you feel a certain way.

It lets you analyze your data through different graphs to understand yourself.

There is a light and dark mode for the ui.

The website automatically saves your data locally on your browser but you cna go to settings to download all your journals to save it in your computers hard drive.

You can add and delete emotions as you wish. 


The reason that there is so little commits is because I didn't know what github commits even were until I was almost 12 hours into the project. Therefore, I never did any. But, I tried my best to keep you guys updated after that point. Please let me know if you have any questions about how I coded the stuff that I did not document through commits.
